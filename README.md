# solar-system website
My first major project delving into GreenSock and ScrollMagic. I tried to create a website that teaches you about the planets in our solar system in a fun manner. Explore this repository and see how I created this project.

# Experience creating this
There are many areas I could improve this project - with the main one being that I could have wrote cleaner and maintainable JavaScript code. My experience with JavaScript when creating this project was basic so within the current timeframe, I was not able to come up with solutions to write cleaner JavaScript.
